### Willard Jones Family [original owner from 1835 - 1890+ ???

##### Willard Jones and family / original owners of property known now as Arbor Vista
- [Willard Jones,(1799-1872)](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/88081931/willard-jones)

###### offspring of Willard and Marcia
"The family at length embraced nine children, but that dread destryoyer, scarlet fever, carried off six of them, four dying within a few days. The living are: De Witt L., whose name heads this sketch; Jennie M., wife of Warren D. Ford, who resides on the old homestead, and Orpha C., who is living in Lake Forest."

The "four dying within a few days" likely refers to Ann (February 14, 1847), Mary (February 9, 1847), Levi (February 10, 1847), and Marcia (March 3, 1847), all of whom died in Feb/March 1847.
