- [Marcia Baxter Jones (1809-1887) / wife of Willard](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/88081911/marcia-d-jones)
###### offspring of Willard and Marcia
"The family at length embraced nine children, but that dread destryoyer, scarlet fever, carried off six of them, four dying within a few days. The living are: De Witt L., whose name heads this sketch; Jennie M., wife of Warren D. Ford, who resides on the old homestead, and Orpha C., who is living in Lake Forest."

The "four dying within a few days" likely refers to Ann (February 14, 1847), Mary (February 9, 1847), Levi (February 10, 1847), and Marcia (March 3, 1847), all of whom died in Feb/March 1847.

Sadly, Laura and Anna both died on May 13, 1860.
