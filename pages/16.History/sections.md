# Arbor Vista History

I am Richard Hoppel, a resident of Arbor Vista since 1998.   I have an interest in history which has led me down this path to documenting the history of Arbor Vista back through the years.  This website currently is a collection of my notes and research activities.  

Feel free to browse around.

If you would like to participate or comment on my information, you can contact me at <rhoppel@gmail.com>

Cheers!
