#### (765 ILCS 160/1-25) Voting

#### Sec. 1-25. Board of managers, board of directors, duties, elections, and __voting.__

(h) Where there is more than one owner of a unit and there is only one member vote associated with that unit, if only one of the multiple owners is present at a meeting of the membership, he or she is entitled to cast the member vote associated with that unit.

(h-5) A member may vote:

- 1) by proxy executed in writing by the member or by his or her duly authorized attorney in fact, provided, however, that the __proxy bears the date of execution.__ Unless the community instruments or the written proxy itself provide otherwise, proxies will not be valid for more than 11 months after the date of its execution; or
- (2) by submitting an association-issued ballot in person at the election meeting; or 
- 3) by submitting an association-issued ballot to the association or its designated agent by mail or other means of delivery specified in the declaration or
- (4) by any electronic or acceptable technological means.

Votes cast under any paragraph of this subsection (h-5) are valid for the purpose of establishing a quorum.

(i) The association may, upon adoption of the appropriate rules by the board, conduct elections by electronic or acceptable technological means. __Members may not vote by proxy in board elections.__ Instructions regarding the use of electronic means or acceptable technological means for voting shall be distributed to all members not less than 10 and not more than 30 days before the election meeting. The instruction notice must include the names of all candidates who have given the board or its authorized agent timely written notice of their candidacy and must give the person voting through electronic or acceptable technological means the opportunity to cast votes for candidates whose names do not appear on the ballot. The board rules shall provide and the instructions provided to the member shall state that a member who submits a vote using electronic or acceptable technological means may request and cast a ballot in person at the election meeting, and thereby void any vote previously submitted by that member.
