! # Arbor Vista Association

__* Arbor Vista Association (AVA) is a voluntary organization

The Arbor Vista Association is a volunteer group of residents and property owners of the Arbor Vista sub-division. It was formed for the purposes set forth in the Constitution. The primary purposes in brief are to maintain and up-grade, if possible, property values in this fine sub-division.

This is done far more readily by residents as a group through their association than by individuals acting independently. Independent action however, in behalf of and in support of the association is very important to continuing success.
