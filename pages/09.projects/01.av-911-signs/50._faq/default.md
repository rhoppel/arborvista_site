### FAQ

- Why is the objective of this project?
  - _Driveway locations can be __VERY__ different from the mailbox locations and __VERY__ confusing.  This is
a particular concern when 911 emergency services need to arrive at the correct driveway location.  Arbor Vista has never had consistent signage.  It is difficult to find house numbers and streets for non-residents, especially at night.  Also, the Lake County Sheriff officers have had discussions with us about difficulty finding locations in Arbor Vista.  Google Maps does not always locate proper house addresses because mailbox and driveways are not registered in their database. Your guests will appreciate the clearly marked driveway signs!_
- My mailbox clearly marks my driveway.  What is the problem?
  - _You are in the minority.  Many mailboxes on the streets are on the opposite side of the property and not even near the driveways.  Several driveways are not even on the same street as the mailbox.  Many mailbox locations have two mailboxes. The number clarity on many mailboxes is very poor.  The mailboxes are laid out for the convenience of the US Postal Service in numerical order, not indicating the closest driveway.  You can review the maps below indicating the mailbox locations. [Red boxes indicate the mailbox locations]_
- Do I have to have a sign installed?
  - _No. Signs will __ONLY__ be installed after a request by the homeowner for a sign and an approval and review by both the homeowner and the Installation Manager._ 
-  When will a sign be installed?
  - _When __YOU__ make contact with the Project Manager and request an installation._
-  How much will it cost?
  - _It is __FREE__ for Arbor Vista Association members in good standing (Your dues payment is current)._ 
- I am not an AVA member.  Can I get a sign?
  - _Not at this time.  Consider joining the AVA so you can get a sign installed for free! Send a check for $50 to "Arbor Vista Association"; PO BOX 433; Grayslake IL 60030 _
-  Where will the sign be installed?
   - _The recommended location is on a post next to the driveway entrance of your choice (many driveways have two entrances). The sign can be your choice of the right or left side of the driveway as __"viewed from the street"__.  An alternative would be mounted to your mailbox post. For many homes the driveway is not that close to the mailbox.  Therefore the driveway location is the preferred choice._
-  Can I install it somewhere else?
  - _Possibly.  Alternatives need to be approved by the Installation Manager_
- Why not only put the sign on mailbox posts?
  - _The mailbox location does not always clearly mark where the correct driveway is located which leads to confusion.  A house number sign located at the end of the driveway near the street is the best location for clarity. On some streets mailboxes are only on one side of the street while others use both sides.  The mailbox location on the street is not consistent in Arbor Vista._
-  Can I install it myself?
  - _We are trying to install the signs in a consistent manner throughout the neighborhood. Ideally, we would like to install the sign to maintain a consistent presentation, but under special circumstances we could allow the homeowner to complete installation with final approval of the Project Manager._
- Who is managing this project?
  - _Richard Hoppel and the Arbor Vista Association Buildings and Grounds manager_
- Do I have to contact any authorities beforehand?
  - _The homeowner does not need to contact anybody except for the Installation Manager. JULIE will be contacted by the Installation Manager before installing a post for a driveway installation sign location. JULIE does not need to be contacted for a mailbox installation. _
- What does the Warren Township Highway Department think about this?
  - _They approve of the concept and continue to work with us to provide ideal installation locations._ 
- Can I get a replacement sign if it is damaged?
  - _Yes, for a fee. Or you can use the link [Smartsign]_
- Where can I buy additional signs?
  - _[SmartSign]_
- Does the US Postal Service have regulations concerning mailboxes?
  - _Yes. [USPS Mailbox Regulations](https://www.mailboss.com/guide-usps-mailbox-regulations/) & [mailbox](https://www.usps.com/manage/mailboxes.htm)_
- Do the USPS Regulations conflict with this project?
  - _No.  USPS require 1" letters minimum mounted on the mailbox.  This sign will fulfill this requirement for a sign mounted on the mailbox._
- Why choose the sign from SmartSign?
  - _Many alternatives were reviewed.  This sign is very visible and readable at night, very customized attractive layout, well-made durable 2-sided aluminum with 3M materials, reasonably priced, and it is easy to order with very fast delivery (a couple of days).  Customer service is outstanding._ 
- What is the post material?
  - _ 1" x 2" composite material about 4 feet in length.  The post would extend 2 feet into the ground to prevent freezes from moving the sign. This provides a very sturdy structure for the sign and it is more attractive than a metal post. Our design is cost-effective, attractive, easy to install and durable while maintaining a vertical position._
