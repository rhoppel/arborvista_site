### FAQ

- Why is is this happening?
  - _We would like for 911 calls to result in emergency services arriving at the correct __driveway__ location.  Driveway locations can be __VERY__ different from the mailbox locations and __VERY__ confusing.  Arbor Vista has never had consistent signage.  It is difficult to find house numbers and streets for non-residents, especially at night.  Also, the Lake County Sheriff officers have had discussions with us about difficulty finding locations in Arbor Vista.  Google maps does not always locate proper house addresses because mailbox and driveways are not registered in their database. Your houseguests will appreciate the clearly marked driveway signs!_
- My mailbox clearly marks my driveway.  What is the problem?
  - _You are in the minority.  Many mailboxes are on the opposite side of the property and not even near the driveways.  Several driveways are not even on the same street as the mailbox.  Many mailbox locations have two mailboxes. The number clarity on many mailboxes is very poor.  The mailboxes are laid out for the convenience of the US Post Office in numerical order, not indicating the closest driveway.  You can review the maps below indicating the mailbox locations. [Red boxes indicate the mailbox locations]_
- Do I have to have a sign installed?
  - _No. Signs will __ONLY__ be installed after an approval and review with the homeowner._ 
-  When will a sign be installed?
  - _When __YOU__ make contact with the Project Manager and arrange an installation._
-  How much will it cost?
  - _It is __FREE__ for Arbor Vista Association members in good standing (Your dues are paid for 2019 and 2018.). Others will have to pay a fee._ 
- I am not a AVA member.  Can I get a sign?
  - _It can be installed for a fee. The cost is TBD.  Consider joining the AVA so you can get a sign installed for free!_
-  Where will the sign be installed?
   - _The recommended location is on a post next to the driveway entrance of your choice (many driveways have two entrances). The sign can be your choice of the right or left side of the driveway as __"viewed from the street"__.  An alternative would be mounted to your mailbox post. For many homes the driveway is not that close to the mailbox.  Therefore the mailbox is a preferred choice._
-  Can I install it somewhere else?
  - _Possibly.  Alternatives need to be approved by the Project Manager_
- Why not only put the sign on mailbox posts?
  - _The mailbox location does not always clearly mark where the correct driveway is located which leads to confusion.  A house number sign located at the end of the driveway near the street is the best location for clarity. On some streets mailboxes are only on one side of the street while others use both sides.  The mailbox side is not consistent in Arbor Vista._
-  Can I install it myself?
  - _We are trying to install the signs in a consistent manner throughout the neighborhood. Ideally we would like to install the sign to maintain a consistent presentation, but under special circumstances we could allow the homeowner to complete installation with final approval of the Project Manager._
- Who is managing this project?
  - _Richard Hoppel and the Arbor Vista Association Buildings and Grounds manager_
- Do I have to contact any authorities beforehand?
  - _Probably.  If a post is to be installed,  JULIE MIGHT have be contacted before installing the post.  The Warren Township Highway Dept. insists on this. However by my reading of the the JULIE requirements, they only need to be contacted if there is digging to be done.  This project requires NO digging, only small a diameter post being driven into the ground about two feet._
- What does the Warren Township Highway Department think about this?
  - _They totally approve of the concept and are working with us to provide an ideal installation.  We will continue to work closely with them during the planning and implementation phase._ 
- Can I get a replacement sign if it is damaged?
  - _Yes, for a fee. Or you can use the link [Smartsign]_
- Where can I buy additional signs?
  - _[SmartSign]_
- Does the US Post Office have regulations concerning mailboxes?
  - _Yes. [USPS Mailbox Regulations](https://www.mailboss.com/guide-usps-mailbox-regulations/) & [mailbox](https://www.usps.com/manage/mailboxes.htm)_
- Do the USPS Regulations conflict with this project?
  - _No.  USPS require 1" letters mounted on the box or post.  This sign will fulfill this requirement._
- Why choose the sign from SmartSign?
  - _Many alternatives have been reviewed and this is the best choice.  The sign is very visible and readable at night, very customized attractive layout, well-made and durable 2-sided aluminum with 3M materials, reasonably priced, and it is easy to order with very fast delivery (a couple of days).  Customer service is outstanding._ 
- What is the post made of?
  - _[<mark>Under evaluation</mark>] Currently the plan is to us a 1" x 2" composite material about 6 feet in length.  The post would extend 3 feet into the ground to prevent freezes from moving the sign. This would provice a very sturdy stucture for the sign and it is more attractive than a metal post.  Metal alternatives will be evaluated when we review some samples.  The final solution needs to be cost-effective, attractive (at least compared to the alternatives), easy to install and durable while maintaining a vertical position._
