[plugin:youtube](https://youtu.be/V33Dulw3iMw)Heide Olsen made a presentation "Arbor Vista: A Place in Time during the 2021 Arbor Vista  Annual meeting on Zoom to a wonderful response from the participants.  The journey begins in the ice age which forms the unique geology of Arbor Vista.   It progresses to habitation of first nation cultures to the surveying of Illinois which creates the property boundaries which remain in place to this day.  Willard Jones, known as the "Squire" was the first settler to stake a claim and eventually purchase the land through the original land grants offered by the State of Illinois.  Eventually the land was purchased and developed by Frederic Dobe who changed the nature of the land into the Dobe Tree Farm http://bit.ly/Dobe_Tree_Farm
