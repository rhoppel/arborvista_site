The history of Arbor Vista is being researched. Historical maps and aerial photos have been added going back to 1861. Got to [History](/history)

===

The research has begun.  The first phase has been completed.  A structure has been set up to collect and distribute research as it is collecte.  Included are very cool and high resolution 1939 Aerial photographs which were commissioned by the state of Illinois documenting the entire state.  There are links under resources to give access to the files I have created and collecte. Enjoy!
